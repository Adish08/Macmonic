# Mac Keys for Windows 🍎 ;) <span style="float: right;">![](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/VisitorHit?user=Adish08&repo=Macmonic&countColor=%23228B22)</span>
Macmonic comes from "mnemonic" (pronounced: nuh-MON-ik) - a memory aid technique - combined with "Mac", representing how this tool helps Mac users (while working with Windows) remember and use familiar Mac keyboard shortcuts without having to relearn new muscle memory.
